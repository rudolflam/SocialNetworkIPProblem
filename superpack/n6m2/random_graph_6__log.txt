Coefficient statistics:
  Matrix range    [1e+00, 6e+00]
  Objective range [1e+00, 3e+00]
  Bounds range    [1e+00, 2e+00]
  RHS range       [1e+00, 6e+00]
Found heuristic solution: objective 11
Presolve removed 128 rows and 74 columns
Presolve time: 0.00s
Presolved: 21 rows, 12 columns, 52 nonzeros

Warning: Thread count (4) is larger than core count (2)
         Reduce the value of the Threads parameter to improve performance

Variable types: 0 continuous, 12 integer (12 binary)
Presolve removed 0 rows and 12 columns

Root relaxation: infeasible, 0 iterations, 0.00 seconds

Explored 0 nodes (0 simplex iterations) in 0.01 seconds
Thread count was 4 (of 2 available processors)

Optimal solution found (tolerance 1.00e-04)
